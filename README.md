# Custom Discord Bot
This repository started out as a repository for  Enicarthage Press Discord Server and possibly other technical stuff.
Now I'm thinking of expanding it.

This Discord Bot Code is deprecated. It needs more work. 

What I want to do is:

- Add more functionalities
- Why not implement some AI? or make it a smart chat bot? (if possible)
- Deploy it to Heroku


I am reworking the code of the Discord Bot to be cleaner and capable of satisfying all basic needs for a discord server.
