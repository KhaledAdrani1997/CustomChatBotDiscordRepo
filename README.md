# Discord Boy
This repository started out as a repository for  Enicarthage Press Discord Server and possibly other technical stuff.
Now I'm thinking of expanding it.

This Discord Bot Code is deprecated. It needs more work. 

What I want to do is:

- Add more functionalities
- Why not implement some AI? or make it a smart chat bot? (if possible)
- Deploy it to Heroku (DONE)

# Update 10/29/2020
Finally we have deployed the bot successfully on heroku. 

This readme will be updated once per week. Of course, this project requires documentation but now let me enjoy my success!

# To authorize your bot on a server
You DONT need ANY logins in your site. If you want your bot to be invited with admin use this link and paste it in your browser https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR-BOTS-ID&permissions=8&scope=bot
