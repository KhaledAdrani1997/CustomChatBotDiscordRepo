What I want to do is:

- Why not implement some AI? or make it a smart chat bot? (if possible)
- Deploy it to Heroku (DONE)

## Introduction
I am developing a Chat Bot for ENICarthage Press Club Discord Server. At first, it started as a NodeJS-based project. Since I started to orient myself toward AI, I decided
that I should add an NLP feature to the simple rule-based bot. As I explored the internet, I realized this project has no limit. 

The bot is already deployed in the Club's server. However, it is pretty much primitive. It needs a lot of work.

What I want to do is:

- Add more rule-based functionalities from Discord.js api
- Add NLP features
- Add the ability to answer any general purpose question (why not? I discovered a way to do it!)


## Updates

10/29/2020: Successfully deployed the bot in Heroku
11/8/2020: I'm still experimenting with a python notebook. I'm still novice in NLP and Keras.

## Quick start

(in progress)

In this part, I'll describe how to develop and test the code.

### To test it locally

- Clone this repository

- Add an .env file where you will be putting several environment variables like the Bot prefix and the Bot Token.

- You have to add this bot to your own server, You DONT need ANY logins in your site. If you want your bot to be invited with admin use this link and paste it in your browser https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR-BOTS-ID&permissions=8&scope=bot

- Run the script `npm run dev`, it should be working.

### To deploy it in Heroku
